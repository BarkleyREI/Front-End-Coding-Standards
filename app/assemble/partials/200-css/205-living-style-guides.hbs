One technique to consider is maintaining static HTML style reference implementations well into integration with server-side / back-end systems. These could be a series of templates or widgets that use the live styles being built. This helps reduce regressions that can happen across the board as the code for the site evolves. Continue to test these reference implementations as they will be the "source of record" for the styles created on the site. They also allow you to more easily distinguish the front-end bugs from the bugs potentially introduced by integration with a complex back-end.

These reference implementations can serve as a living style guide and broken components are easily spotted in testing over time.

Defining a solid style guide to be applied to tag names can significantly reduce the size of the CSS if that style guide is adhered to by both the design and development teams. It is recommended that a style guide is agreed upon at the beginning of a project, defined in HTML and then iterated on by both the design and development teams.

For BarkleyREI’s purposes, the living style guide can be satisfied by the statically coded templates. All new work should be done statically and tested before integrating into a CMS. Care should be taken to maintain the integrity of the existing styles and markup, and maintain parity with the CMS-integrated versions.
